# MIT 8.022 — Electricity and Magnetism

This repository contains my complete work for **MIT 8.022: Electricity and Magnetism**, covering the full progression of the course from electrostatics to electromagnetic energy flow and waves.

The emphasis throughout is on **understanding physical principles, internal structure, and limiting cases**, rather than on memorization or isolated problem-solving techniques.

## Scope of the Course

MIT 8.022 develops classical electromagnetism in a **logical sequence**, gradually increasing abstraction and unification. The material covered includes:

- Electrostatics and electric fields  
- Gauss’s law and symmetry-based field determination  
- Electric potential and energy  
- Capacitors, dielectrics, and energy storage  
- Steady currents and magnetic fields  
- Ampère’s law and magnetic energy  
- Inductance and mutual inductance  
- Time-dependent fields and displacement current  
- Energy conservation in electromagnetism  
- The Poynting vector and electromagnetic energy flow  
- Circuits, cables, and transmission lines viewed from a field perspective  

Maxwell’s equations emerge naturally toward the end of the course as a **unifying framework**, rather than as a starting assumption.

## What This Repository Contains

- Fully written **problem set solutions** in LaTeX and compiled PDF form  
- Solutions organized to follow the conceptual progression of the course  
- Explicit use of symmetry arguments and conservation laws  
- Careful distinction between fields, sources, and geometry  
- Physical interpretation accompanying formal derivations  

The work reflects completion of **all assigned material** in the course.

## Problem-Solving Approach

Across the course, the approach taken was consistent:

1. Identify the **physical regime** (static, steady-state, or time-dependent)  
2. Choose the governing law appropriate to that regime  
3. Use symmetry and geometry to simplify before calculation  
4. Track energy and power explicitly where relevant  
5. Interpret results in terms of physical behavior, not just formulas  

Calculations are kept as simple as possible without sacrificing correctness.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

- A **complete record** of my work for MIT 8.022  
- A reference for revisiting core ideas in classical electromagnetism  
- Preparation for further study in waves, optics, and advanced physics  

It is not intended as a shortcut or solution manual, but as a coherent body of work corresponding to the full course.
